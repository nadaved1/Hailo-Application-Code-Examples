# Model Compilation
In this rea you would find examples for converting `ONNX` or `tflite` NN models conversion to run on Hailo device.
This inclues:
* Parsing the model, and creating Hailo's intermediate representation - HAR file
* Optimzing the model, including quantizing the model into lower bit representation
* Compiling the optimize model into a HEF file.
